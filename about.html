        <h3>About this mini project</h3>
        <article>
            <p>I was searching the internet for project ideas to start my portfolio.<br> This is one of the results I found and liked at first. But after starting working on this project I realized I didn't like it anymore, because it seemed too simple. So I started to modify and add whatever I came up with. It's still a simple, basic project, but I find it more complex than the initial idea.</p>
            <p>Bellow you will see the initial description of the project as I found it.</p>
            <p>For the final version, I don't believe that instructions/descriptions are needed. </p>

        <h2>Original idea</h2>
        <article>
            <h3><strong>Title: FlipImage</strong></h3>
            <h3>Tier: 1-Beginner</h3>
            <p>It’s important for Web Developers to understand the basics of manipulating images since rich web applications rely on images to add value to the user interface and user experience (UI/UX).</p>
            <p>FlipImage explores one aspect of image manipulation — image rotation. This app displays a square pane containing a single image presented in a 2x2 matrix. Using a set of up, down, left, and right arrows adjacent to each of the images the user may flip them vertically or horizontally.</p>
            <p>You must only use native HTML, CSS, and Javascript to implement this app. Image packages and libraries are not allowed.</p>
            <h3>User Stories:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>User can see a pane containing a single image repeated in a 2x2 matrix</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Bonus features:</h3>
            <ul>
